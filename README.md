# linreg-sgd_nb
A moderately large Jupyter notebook that describes, implements, and compares linear regression and gradient descent on three datasets

Adapted from a notebook I wrote for my CSC 566 - Topics in Advanced Data Mining class

The three datasets used:

- US Real GDP data

- King County Housing market data

- Melbourne Housing market data
